Text Summarization using Pointer Generator Networks(PGN) as discussed in https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator and https://github.com/steph1793/Pointer_Generator_Summarizer with newer version of Tensorflow

This project reads tfrecords format files. For the study, I will be working on the CNN/Dailymail and BBC datasets. You can download the preprocessed files with this link : https://github.com/JafferWilson/Process-Data-of-CNN-DailyMail (for CNN/DM)

Or do the pre-processing by yourself with this link : https://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail

BBC dataset's transition from text to tfrecords format is on the way.
